# Sandpile Project Project 
Self-organized criticality simulation using the sandpile model. SAS/IML implementation analyzing avalanche sizes, power-law distributions and 1/f noise via log-log regression. Illustrates how complex systems generate scale-free dynamics similar to financial market fluctuations.
